## Happy Thoughts

In this project, we created our own version of a twitter page where anyone can write
and send a happy thought for everyone to enjoy. This is a React project and this week
we started working with useEffect for the first time. We also had a design we needed to follow.

## The project

I started with planning my work in figma, added the design, colors, and fonts I would need.
laid out all of the requirements I needed to do and made a list of how I would structure my work.

This week we learned about the life cycle of components, how to use APIs in react and how we would
use the useEffect with the props and useState that we recently learned.

Edit: I also added my own API using mongo db!
